# Final Project Drougths vs Election Results - A visual exploration

Project Description

The goal of this project is to explore data visually in order to conclude whether a hypothesis could be formulated. The data depicts two unrelated kinds of datasets: Firstly, national data on the occurrence of droughts. Secondly, data on national election results on the county level. Is it possible to hypothesize about correlation and causation by visualising this data? The goal of this project will be achieved by projecting drought data and election results on maps of Germany and the USA. The main challenge ogf this project lies in matching drought data and electoral reuslts on the county level. No such data is available for Germany.
